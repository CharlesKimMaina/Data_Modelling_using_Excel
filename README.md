You can now start dragging different columns to diffrent fields eg ROWS, COLUMNS, FILTERS, VALUE etc 
Now you can create different pivot tables of your liking and analyse your data. 
Now in your pivot table, right click it and select "Pivot Table Options", click display and tick✅"Classic Pivottable layout- enables dragging of the fields in the grid" n OK.
